# Quick Start: Your First Compliance Project

**Goal**: Set up a basic compliance foundation in under 30 minutes.

This tutorial walks you through creating your first compliance project using our step-by-step approach. You'll learn by doing, not just reading.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of your organization's structure
- Access to your company's security policies (if any)
- 30 minutes of focused time

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- A compliance project scope document
- A basic risk assessment framework
- Your first security control implemented
- A roadmap for next steps

## Step 1: Define Your Scope (5 minutes)

Start by clearly defining what you're protecting:

```markdown
# Project Scope Template

**Organization**: [Your Company Name]
**Scope**: [What systems/data are in scope?]
**Exclusions**: [What's explicitly out of scope?]
**Stakeholders**: [Who needs to be involved?]
```

**Action**: Fill out this template with your organization's details.

## Step 2: Identify Your Assets (10 minutes)

List your critical information assets:

| Asset            | Type   | Owner  | Criticality |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| Customer data    | Data   | [Name] | High        |
| Source code      | Data   | [Name] | High        |
| Employee records | Data   | [Name] | Medium      |
| Office network   | System | [Name] | Medium      |

**Action**: Create your own asset inventory table.

## Step 3: Assess Basic Risks (10 minutes)

For each high-criticality asset, identify:

- What could go wrong?
- How likely is it?
- What's the impact?

**Example**:

- **Risk**: Customer data breach
- **Likelihood**: Medium (we have basic security)
- **Impact**: High (regulatory fines, reputation damage)
- **Risk Level**: High

**Action**: Complete a risk assessment for your top 3 assets.

## Step 4: Implement Your First Control (5 minutes)

Choose one high-priority risk and implement a basic control:

**Example**: For customer data protection

- **Control**: Password policy
- **Implementation**: Require 12+ character passwords
- **Documentation**: Create a simple policy document

**Action**: Implement and document one control for your highest-risk item.

## What You've Accomplished

✅ Defined your compliance scope  
✅ Identified critical assets  
✅ Completed basic risk assessment  
✅ Implemented your first security control

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't know what assets we have"**

- Start with customer data, employee records, and source code
- Ask your IT team or leadership for input

**"Risk assessment seems overwhelming"**

- Focus on your top 3 most critical assets
- Use simple High/Medium/Low ratings
- You can refine this later

**"I'm not sure about scope"**

- Start small - you can always expand later
- Focus on customer-facing systems first
- Document what you exclude and why

# How to Define Your Compliance Scope

**Task**: Define the boundaries of your compliance program.

This guide provides specific steps to define your compliance scope for ISO 27001 or SOC 2. Follow these steps to create a clear, defensible scope that meets your business needs and audit requirements.

## Before You Start

**What you need**:
- Understanding of your organization's structure
- Access to key stakeholders
- Knowledge of your systems and processes
- 1-2 hours for scope definition

**What you'll get**:
- Clear scope statement
- System boundaries defined
- Stakeholder alignment
- Audit-ready documentation

## Step 1: Understand Scope Requirements (15 minutes)

### ISO 27001 Scope Requirements

ISO 27001 requires you to define:

**Organizational Scope**: Which parts of your organization are included
**System Scope**: Which systems, processes, and data are included
**Geographic Scope**: Which locations are included
**Temporal Scope**: The time period for implementation

### SOC 2 Scope Requirements

SOC 2 requires you to define:

**System Description**: What your system does and includes
**System Boundaries**: What's in and out of scope
**Subservice Organizations**: Third-party services you use
**Trust Services Criteria**: Which criteria you're addressing

**Action**: Review the scope requirements for your chosen standard.

## Step 2: Map Your Organization (30 minutes)

### Identify Organizational Units

Create an organizational map:

```markdown
# Organizational Scope Template

**In Scope**:
- [ ] IT Department
- [ ] Security Team
- [ ] Development Team
- [ ] Customer Support
- [ ] Finance (for customer data processing)

**Out of Scope**:
- [ ] Marketing (no access to customer data)
- [ ] Sales (limited system access)
- [ ] Legal (separate systems)
- [ ] HR (separate systems)

**Rationale**: [Explain why each unit is in or out of scope]
```

**Action**: Complete your organizational scope mapping.

### Identify Systems and Applications

Create a system inventory:

```markdown
# System Scope Template

**In Scope Systems**:
| System | Purpose | Data Types | Criticality |
|--------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Customer Database | Store customer data | PII, Business | High |
| Payment System | Process payments | Financial | High |
| User Portal | Customer access | PII, Business | Medium |
| Admin Tools | System management | Configuration | Medium |

**Out of Scope Systems**:
| System | Purpose | Reason for Exclusion |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Marketing CRM | Lead management | No customer data |
| Internal Wiki | Documentation | No sensitive data |
| Development Tools | Code management | Separate environment |
```

**Action**: Complete your system scope mapping.

## Step 3: Define Geographic Boundaries (15 minutes)

### Identify Locations

Map your geographic scope:

```markdown
# Geographic Scope Template

**In Scope Locations**:
- [ ] Primary office (San Francisco, CA)
- [ ] Secondary office (New York, NY)
- [ ] Cloud data centers (AWS US-East-1, US-West-2)
- [ ] Remote workers (US-based only)

**Out of Scope Locations**:
- [ ] International offices (separate legal entities)
- [ ] Partner locations (not under our control)
- [ ] Employee home offices (personal equipment)

**Rationale**: [Explain geographic boundaries]
```

**Action**: Complete your geographic scope mapping.

## Step 4: Document Your Scope Statement (30 minutes)

### Create Scope Statement

Write a clear, concise scope statement:

```markdown
# Scope Statement Template

**Organization**: [Your Company Name]

**Scope**: The [ISO 27001 ISMS / SOC 2 System] covers [specific systems, processes, and data] that support [business function] for [customer types].

**In Scope**:
- [List key systems and processes]
- [List organizational units]
- [List data types]

**Out of Scope**:
- [List excluded systems and processes]
- [List excluded organizational units]
- [List excluded data types]

**Rationale**: [Explain the business justification for scope boundaries]

**Effective Date**: [Date]
**Review Date**: [Date - typically annual]
```

**Action**: Draft your scope statement.

## Step 5: Validate with Stakeholders (15 minutes)

### Review with Key Stakeholders

Present your scope to:

- **Leadership**: Ensure business alignment
- **IT Team**: Verify technical accuracy
- **Legal Team**: Confirm regulatory compliance
- **Audit Team**: Validate audit readiness

### Document Feedback

Record stakeholder input:

```markdown
# Stakeholder Review Template

**Stakeholder**: [Name/Role]
**Feedback**: [Specific comments]
**Action Required**: [Changes needed]
**Status**: [Open/Closed]
```

**Action**: Conduct stakeholder review and document feedback.

## Common Scope Definition Mistakes

### Too Broad Scope
**Problem**: Including everything makes compliance unmanageable
**Solution**: Focus on customer-facing systems and critical data

### Too Narrow Scope
**Problem**: Excluding important systems creates gaps
**Solution**: Include all systems that process customer data

### Unclear Boundaries
**Problem**: Vague scope statements create audit issues
**Solution**: Be specific about what's in and out of scope

### Missing Rationale
**Problem**: No justification for scope decisions
**Solution**: Document business reasons for scope boundaries

## Scope Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Company
**Scope**: Customer-facing web application and supporting infrastructure
**In Scope**: Web app, database, payment processing, customer support tools
**Out of Scope**: Internal HR systems, marketing tools, development environments

### Example 2: Financial Services
**Scope**: Core banking systems and customer data processing
**In Scope**: Core banking platform, customer portal, payment systems
**Out of Scope**: Employee benefits systems, marketing databases

### Example 3: Healthcare Provider
**Scope**: Patient care systems and protected health information
**In Scope**: EMR system, patient portal, billing systems
**Out of Scope**: Administrative systems, research databases

## Next Steps

Once you have defined your scope:

1. **Get approval**: Secure leadership sign-off on scope
2. **Document controls**: Map controls to your scope
3. **Implement monitoring**: Set up scope monitoring processes
4. **Plan reviews**: Schedule regular scope reviews

## Troubleshooting

**"Our scope keeps changing"**
- Document scope change process
- Require formal approval for changes
- Update scope statement regularly

**"Auditors question our scope"**
- Ensure scope aligns with business objectives
- Document clear rationale for boundaries
- Be prepared to defend scope decisions

**"Scope is too complex"**
- Simplify by focusing on customer data
- Start with core systems only
- Expand scope gradually over time

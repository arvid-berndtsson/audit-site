3. **Information security policy** development
4. **Risk assessment methodology** establishment

### Phase 2: Risk Management (Months 3-6)
1. **Asset identification** and classification
2. **Risk assessment** and treatment planning
3. **Statement of Applicability** (SoA) development
4. **Risk treatment plan** implementation

### Phase 3: Controls Implementation (Months 6-9)
1. **Documentation** of procedures and processes
2. **Training** and awareness programs
3. **Technical controls** implementation
4. **Monitoring** and measurement systems

### Phase 4: Certification Preparation (Months 9-12)
1. **Internal audits** and management reviews
2. **Corrective actions** and improvements
3. **Certification audit** preparation

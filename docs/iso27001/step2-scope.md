# Step 2: Scope Definition

## Overview

Defining the scope of your ISO 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) is crucial for a successful implementation. The scope determines what parts of your organization will be covered by the certification.

## What is Scope?

The scope defines:
- **Organizational boundaries**: Which departments, locations, or business units
- **Information assets**: What data and systems are included
- **Processes**: Which business processes are in scope
- **Technology**: What systems, applications, and infrastructure

## Scope Considerations

### 1. Start Small
- Begin with core business processes
- Focus on critical information assets
- Include key systems and applications
- Expand scope over time

### 2. Business Alignment
- Align with business objectives
- Include customer-facing systems
- Consider regulatory requirements
- Match organizational structure

### 3. Resource Constraints
- Available budget and resources
- Staff expertise and capacity
- Timeline requirements
- External dependencies

## Scope Statement Template

```
The ISMS scope covers:
- [Department/Location]: [Description]
- [Systems]: [List of key systems]
- [Processes]: [Core business processes]
- [Information]: [Types of data handled]
- [Exclusions]: [What's not included and why]
```

## Next Steps

Once scope is defined, you can begin implementing your ISMS controls and policies. Consider reviewing the [ISO 27001 Overview](../basics/iso27001-overview.md) for additional context.

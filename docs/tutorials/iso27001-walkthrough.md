# ISO 27001 Walkthrough: From Zero to Certification

**Goal**: Complete a full ISO 27001 implementation cycle in this hands-on tutorial.

This tutorial guides you through a complete ISO 27001 implementation, from initial planning to certification readiness. You'll build a real ISMS that you can use in your organization.

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [Quick Start Tutorial](./quick-start.md)
- Basic understanding of your organization's security posture
- Access to key stakeholders and systems
- 2-3 hours for the full walkthrough

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- A complete ISMS framework
- Risk assessment and treatment plan
- Control implementation roadmap
- Internal audit program
- Management review process

## Phase 1: Foundation (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Leadership Commitment

Create your leadership commitment document:

```markdown
# Leadership Commitment Statement

**Date**: [Today's Date]
**Organization**: [Your Company]

We commit to:
- Establishing an Information Security Management System

- Supporting continuous improvement
- Ensuring compliance with ISO 27001:2022

**Signed**: [Executive Name]
**Title**: [Title]
```

**Action**: Draft and get this signed by your leadership.

### Step 2: Scope Definition

Expand your scope from the quick start:

```markdown
# ISMS Scope Statement

**In Scope**:
- Customer data processing systems
- Employee information systems
- Development and production environments
- Third-party service providers

**Out of Scope**:
- Personal devices (BYOD)
- Legacy systems (scheduled for retirement)
- Non-digital information assets
```

**Action**: Define your complete ISMS scope.

## Phase 2: Risk Management (45 minutes)

### Step 3: Asset Inventory

Create a comprehensive asset inventory:

| Asset ID | Name | Type | Owner | Location | Criticality |
|----------|------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| ASST-001 | Customer Database | Data | CTO | Cloud | High |
| ASST-002 | Source Code Repository | Data | CTO | Cloud | High |
| ASST-003 | Employee Directory | Data | HR | Cloud | Medium |
| ASST-004 | Office Network | System | IT | On-premise | Medium |

**Action**: Complete your asset inventory with at least 10 assets.

### Step 4: Risk Assessment

For each high-criticality asset, assess risks:

```markdown
# Risk Assessment Template

**Asset**: [Asset Name]
**Risk ID**: RISK-001

**Threat**: Unauthorized access
**Vulnerability**: Weak authentication
**Likelihood**: Medium (3)
**Impact**: High (5)
**Risk Level**: 15 (High)

**Treatment**: Implement multi-factor authentication
**Owner**: [Name]
**Timeline**: [Date]
```

**Action**: Complete risk assessments for your top 5 assets.

## Phase 3: Control Implementation (60 minutes)

### Step 5: Control Selection

Map your risks to ISO 27001:2022 controls:

| Risk | Control | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Data breach | A.5.1 Information security policies | Create security policy |
| Unauthorized access | A.5.15 Access control | Implement MFA |
| Data loss | A.5.10 Cryptography | Encrypt sensitive data |
| System compromise | A.5.7 Human resource security | Security training |

**Action**: Map your top risks to specific controls.

### Step 6: Policy Development

Create your first security policy:

```markdown
# Information Security Policy

**Purpose**: Protect our information assets
**Scope**: All employees and systems
**Policy**: 
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters)
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Report security incidents immediately

**Responsibilities**: [Define who does what]
**Compliance**: [How to measure compliance]
```

**Action**: Create and implement your first policy.

## Phase 4: Monitoring and Improvement (45 minutes)

### Step 7: Internal Audit Program

Set up your audit program:

```markdown
# Internal Audit Schedule

**Q1**: Access control audit
**Q2**: Data protection audit  
**Q3**: Incident response audit
**Q4**: Management review

**Audit Checklist**:
- [ ] Policies documented
- [ ] Controls implemented
- [ ] Training completed
- [ ] Incidents tracked
```

**Action**: Create your audit schedule and checklist.

### Step 8: Management Review

Prepare for your first management review:

```markdown
# Management Review Agenda

**Date**: [Next Month]
**Attendees**: [Leadership Team]

**Topics**:
1. ISMS performance review
2. Risk assessment updates
3. Control effectiveness
4. Resource requirements
5. Improvement opportunities

**Actions**: [Document decisions and actions]
```

**Action**: Schedule and prepare for your first review.

# SOC 2 Walkthrough: From Zero to Attestation

**Goal**: Complete a full SOC 2 implementation cycle in this hands-on tutorial.

This tutorial guides you through a complete SOC 2 implementation, from initial planning to Type II attestation readiness. You'll build a real Trust Services Criteria framework that you can use in your organization.

## Prerequisites

- Completed the [Quick Start Tutorial](./quick-start.md)
- Basic understanding of your organization's security posture
- Access to key stakeholders and systems
- 2-3 hours for the full walkthrough

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- A complete Trust Services Criteria framework
- Control objectives and activities
- Testing and monitoring procedures
- Management assertion process
- Readiness for external audit

## Phase 1: Foundation (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Understand Trust Services Criteria

SOC 2 is built around five Trust Services Criteria:

**Security (Common Criteria)**: Always required
- **Availability**: System availability for operation and use
- **Processing Integrity**: System processing is complete, accurate, timely, and authorized
- **Confidentiality**: Information designated as confidential is protected
- **Privacy**: Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of in conformity with commitments

**Action**: Determine which criteria apply to your organization.

### Step 2: Define Your System Description

Create your system description:

```markdown
# System Description Template

**System Name**: [Your System Name]
**System Overview**: [Brief description of what your system does]
**System Boundaries**: [What's included/excluded]
**Key System Components**: [List main components]
**Key Subservice Organizations**: [Third-party services used]
```

**Action**: Complete your system description.

## Phase 2: Control Environment (45 minutes)

### Step 3: Establish Control Environment

The control environment sets the tone for your organization:

```markdown
# Control Environment Assessment

**Commitment to Integrity and Ethical Values**:
- [ ] Code of conduct established
- [ ] Ethics training provided
- [ ] Violations addressed promptly

**Board Oversight**:
- [ ] Security committee established
- [ ] Regular reporting to board
- [ ] Board receives security updates

**Management Philosophy and Operating Style**:
- [ ] Security-first approach
- [ ] Risk-aware decision making
- [ ] Continuous improvement culture
```

**Action**: Assess and document your control environment.

### Step 4: Define Control Objectives

For each Trust Services Criteria, define control objectives:

**Security (Common Criteria)**:
- **CC1.0**: Control Environment
- **CC2.0**: Communication and Information
- **CC3.0**: Risk Assessment
- **CC4.0**: Monitoring Activities
- **CC5.0**: Control Activities
- **CC6.0**: Logical and Physical Access Controls
- **CC7.0**: System Operations
- **CC8.0**: Change Management
- **CC9.0**: Risk Mitigation

**Action**: Map your controls to these objectives.

## Phase 3: Control Implementation (60 minutes)

### Step 5: Implement Security Controls

Start with the Common Criteria (Security):

**CC6.0 - Logical and Physical Access Controls**:

```markdown
# Access Control Implementation

**Control Objective**: CC6.1 - The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over protected information assets to protect them from security events to meet the entity's security objectives.

**Control Activities**:
- [ ] User access provisioning procedures
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms (MFA)
- [ ] Authorization controls
- [ ] Access review procedures
- [ ] Segregation of duties

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Access request forms
- User access reviews
- Authentication logs
- Authorization matrices
```

**Action**: Implement and document your access controls.

### Step 6: Implement Additional Criteria

If applicable, implement other Trust Services Criteria:

**Availability**:
```markdown
# Availability Controls

**Control Objective**: A1.1 - The entity maintains, monitors, and evaluates current processing capacity and use of system components (infrastructure, data, and software) to manage capacity demand and to enable the implementation of additional capacity to help meet its objectives.

**Control Activities**:
- [ ] Capacity monitoring
- [ ] Performance baselines
- [ ] Scalability planning
- [ ] Incident response procedures
```

**Action**: Implement availability controls if applicable.

## Phase 4: Testing and Monitoring (45 minutes)

### Step 7: Design Testing Procedures

Create testing procedures for your controls:

```markdown
# Control Testing Procedures

**Control**: User Access Review
**Test Objective**: Verify that user access is reviewed quarterly
**Test Procedure**:
1. Obtain list of system users
2. Verify access review was performed
3. Check for approval signatures
4. Confirm access changes were made
5. Document exceptions

**Sample Size**: 100% of users
**Frequency**: Quarterly
```

**Action**: Create testing procedures for your key controls.

### Step 8: Establish Monitoring

Set up ongoing monitoring:

```markdown
# Monitoring Schedule

**Daily**:
- [ ] Security event monitoring
- [ ] System availability checks
- [ ] Access attempt monitoring

**Weekly**:
- [ ] Vulnerability scans
- [ ] Backup verification
- [ ] Performance monitoring

**Monthly**:
- [ ] User access reviews
- [ ] Policy compliance checks
- [ ] Risk assessment updates

**Quarterly**:
- [ ] Control testing
- [ ] Management review
- [ ] Training updates
```

**Action**: Establish your monitoring schedule.

## Phase 5: Documentation and Assertion (30 minutes)

### Step 9: Prepare Management Assertion

Create your management assertion:

```markdown
# Management Assertion Template

**Date**: [Date]
**Period**: [Audit Period]

**Assertion**: Management of [Company Name] asserts that:

1. The description of the system is fairly presented in all material respects.
2. The controls were suitably designed and operating effectively throughout the period.
3. The controls met the applicable trust services criteria throughout the period.

**Basis for Assertion**:
- Regular control testing
- Ongoing monitoring activities
- Management review processes
- Incident response procedures

**Signed**: [Management Name]
**Title**: [Title]
**Date**: [Date]
```

**Action**: Draft your management assertion.

### Step 10: Prepare for External Audit

Get ready for your SOC 2 audit:

```markdown
# Audit Preparation Checklist

**Documentation Ready**:
- [ ] System description
- [ ] Control objectives
- [ ] Control activities
- [ ] Testing procedures
- [ ] Monitoring results
- [ ] Management assertion

**Evidence Organized**:
- [ ] Policy documents
- [ ] Procedure manuals
- [ ] Training records
- [ ] Testing results
- [ ] Monitoring reports
- [ ] Incident logs

**Key Personnel Available**:
- [ ] System administrators
- [ ] Security personnel
- [ ] Management representatives
- [ ] Process owners
```

**Action**: Complete your audit preparation.

✅ Built audit-ready documentation  

## Next Steps

Your SOC 2 framework is now operational! Continue with:

- **Deep Dive**: Explore specific [How-to Guides](../how-to/executive-buyin.md)
- **Reference**: Check [SOC 2 Criteria](../reference/soc2-criteria.md)
- **Certification**: Prepare for external audit

## Troubleshooting

**"Which Trust Services Criteria should I include?"**
- Start with Security (Common Criteria) only
- Add others based on customer requirements
- Consider your business model and data types

**"Control testing seems overwhelming"**
- Focus on key controls first
- Use sampling for large populations
- Document everything you test

**"Management assertion seems formal"**
- Keep it simple and accurate
- Base it on actual testing results
- Have management review and approve
